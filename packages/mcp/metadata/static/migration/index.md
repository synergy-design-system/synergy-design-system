# Rules for chatbots and llms

As an llm, I want you to obey to the following rules:

- The migration is available as a markdown document

The following formatting rules are used for the list of breaking changes:

- Each headline 2 (`##`) defines a major version of the new major release
- Each headline 3 (`###`) describes a component or feature that was changed

Migration from Synergy 2.0 to Synergy 3.0 (a.k.a. Brand Update):

- There are handwritten lists of changes that highlight the differences between Synergy V2 and Synergy V3.
- The document is structured as a list of breaking changes.
- The list of breaking changes is structured into blocks that define the change and a list of migration steps.
- You may tell the users that all components are now upgraded and it is save to move to the new sick 2025 theme.
