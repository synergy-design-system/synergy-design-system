# @synergy-design-system/mcp

Synergy MCP Server â€“ Multi-Framework Component Metadata & Tooling

---

The `@synergy-design-system/mcp` package provides a server-side interface for Synergy Design System components, assets, and design tokens. It enables integration and documentation of component metadata, code samples, icon information, and tooling for Angular, React, Vue, and Web Components. The MCP tools deliver structured information and code samples for using Synergy components across frameworks, along with design assets and migration guides.

## Local Setup

To run the MCP server locally, install the `@synergy-design-system/mcp` package in your project. You can launch the server using `npx @synergy-design-system/mcp` from your project directory. For integration with VS Code, add a configuration under `mcp.servers` in your `settings.json` to connect via stdio. Example configuration:

```jsonc
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "synergy": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@synergy-design-system/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project` with your actual project directory.

## Directory Structure & Metadata

- Component metadata and code samples are located in the `metadata/` folder, organized by component and framework.
- Example: `metadata/syn-button/angular.md`, `metadata/syn-button/react.md`
- The tools aggregate and serve this data as structured JSON responses.

## Best Practices for Metadata & Code Samples

- Use one Markdown or JSON file per component and framework for metadata and samples.
- Code samples should be runnable and tailored to the respective framework.
- Clearly document API information, props, events, and slots.

## Extension & Integration

- New tools can be added in the `src/tools/` directory.
- Metadata loaders and parsers are located in `src/utilities/`.
- The tool API is designed for easy extension to additional frameworks and components.

## Example: Tool Usage

```bash
"Show me all available Synergy components"
