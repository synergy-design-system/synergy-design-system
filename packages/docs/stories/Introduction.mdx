# Introduction of the Synergy Design System

## Guiding principles

Synergy Components are part of the Solid Design System, serving as a robust foundation for SICKS digital presence, built upon three core principles which should be kept in mind by designers, developers and stakeholders.

### 🔗 Connected – Building on Trust
We build on trusted vendors, proven standards and the expertise of our community, to focus on what's relevant for our brand and users.

### 🤝 Unified – Building Together, Always
As developers and designers we shape a single product by learning from and being responsible for each other.

### 🔮 Progressive – Guiding into Tomorrow
We stay ahead, making our design system more flexible for our brand's future needs, while keeping it easy for users.

These principles help us to achieve our goals.
