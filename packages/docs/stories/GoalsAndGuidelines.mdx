# Guiding principles and vision of the Synergy Design System

## Guiding principles

<p style={{fontSize: "large"}}>The Synergy Design System serves as a robust foundation for SICK's digital landscape, built upon three core principles which should be kept in mind by designers, developers and stakeholders.</p>


### <img src="/progressive.svg" height="24"/> Progressive – Guiding into Tomorrow
We stay ahead, making our design system more flexible for our brand's future needs, while keeping it easy for users.
### <img src="/unified.svg" height="24"/> Unified – Building Together, Always
As developers and designers we shape a single product by learning from and being responsible for each other.
### <img src="/connected.svg" height="24"/> Connected – Building on Trust
We build on trusted vendors, proven standards and the expertise of our community, to focus on what's relevant for our brand and users.

These principles help us to achieve our goals.
