# Handling breaking changes between major versions

This guide holds the required information for migrating from one major version of `@synergy-design-system/assets` to the next.

> ⚠️ Migrations **must** always be done from one major version to the next to prevent issues (e.g. with types and property changes)
> This means when moving from `@synergy-design-system@assets` v1.x to v3.x,
> you will **have to apply** the changes from v1.x to v2.x first!
