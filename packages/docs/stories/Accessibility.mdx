# Accessibility

## What's it all about?

In today's digital age, ensuring that web applications are accessible to everyone is not just a legal requirement but a moral imperative.
Accessibility in web development means designing and building websites and applications that can be used by people of all abilities and disabilities.
This includes individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

## Why accessibility matters?

**Inclusivity**: Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use our web applications.
This inclusivity fosters a more diverse and equitable digital environment.

**Legal compliance**: Many countries have laws and regulations that require digital content to be accessible.
Non-compliance can lead to legal repercussions and damage to the company's reputation.

**Enhanced user experience**: Accessible design often leads to a better overall user experience.
Features like keyboard navigation, contrast, readable text benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.

**Market reach**: By making our web applications accessible, we can reach a broader audience, including the millions of people with disabilities worldwide.

## Accessibility in design systems
A design system is a collection of reusable components and guidelines that ensure consistency and efficiency in design and development.
Just like our base library and role model [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/resources/accessibility) we promise to build each component with accessibility in mind.

### Key aspects
**Component-level accessibility**: Each component in our design system is built to be accessible.
This includes ensuring proper color contrast, keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.

**Holistic approach**: While component-level accessibility is crucial, it's not the whole picture.
Accessibility must be integrated into the entire application. This means considering the user journey,
ensuring that all interactions are accessible, and testing the application with real users who have disabilities.

**Progressive approach**: Accessibility is not a binary (yes/no) and not a one-time task either but an ongoing process.
We strive to making Synergy as accessibility as possible and improve it continuously.
As Synergy evolves, we continuously test and improve our components to meet the latest accessibility standards and best practices.

## Our commitment to accessibility
We are committed to making Synergy components accessible to everyone, so we decided to make it part of our Definition-of-Done.
Synergy is always developed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that every component is usable by all users.
We believe that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of good design and are dedicated to continuously improving our practices to create a more inclusive digital world.
