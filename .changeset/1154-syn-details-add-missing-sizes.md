feat: ✨ Add new size `small` to `<syn-details>` and `<syn-accordion>` (#1154)

The `<syn-details>` element was the only element with a `size` property that had no `small` variant.
This was now added for consistency with other elements that have a `size` property.

This can be used via `<syn-details size="small"></syn-details>` or `<syn-accordion size="small"></syn-accordion>`.
