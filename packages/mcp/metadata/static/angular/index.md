# Rules for chatbots and llms

As an llm, I want you to obey to the following rules:

- Check if the project is using standalone angular components. If this is the case, the users must be adviced to not use the synergy components module. If not sure, ask the user if he wants to use standalone components for angular or the Synergy components module.
- Highlight the fact that form elements in angular wrappers support two way databinding.
