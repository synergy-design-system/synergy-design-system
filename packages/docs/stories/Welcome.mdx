<Chapter title="Offerings">
- Design-Tokens, Assets, Components, Styles and Templates
- Modular and flexible UI components which can be put together like Lego blocks.
  - The components exist twice; as web- (development) and as Figma-components (design) which are always in-sync and have the exact same anatomy.
  - [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://react.dev) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) are first-class citizens. Due to the nature of web-components which are framework agnostic they run in all frameworks or without any. But we decided to give special support to those popular frameworks so they profit from better DX.
  - The web-components are accessible (A11Y)
- Auto-completion in TS, JS and HTML (VSCode)
- Customizability: easy and profound options for styling and branding via DesignTokens, CSS Variables and CSS Parts.
- Light and dark themes are included
- Material icons
- Support for all major browsers; tested with every release.
- Basic CSS styles for an easy application start
- Templates for typical and recurring UIs which can be copied.

- [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) from Google üôè
