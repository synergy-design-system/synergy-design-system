feat: ✨ Added readonly for various form fields (#1171, #1174, #1175, #1176, #1178)

Applies to:

- `<syn-checkbox>`
- `<syn-radio>`
- `<syn-radio-group>`
- `<syn-range>`
- `<syn-switch>`

Form elements now support being displayed as `readonly` fields.

Field marked `readonly` may receive focus, but their value cannot be changed by customer inputs.
