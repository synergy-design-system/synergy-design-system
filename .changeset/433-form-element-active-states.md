feat: ✨ form element active states (#433)

This release adds adjustments for `:active` states for various form elements.

- `<syn-checkbox>` will show an active indicator when an item is unchecked.
- `<syn-nav-item>` will use `--syn-interactive-background-color-active` as an active background
- `<syn-radio>` will show its active indicator when pressing the associated label, too.
- `<syn-switch>` now has a new active states, dependent on if it is checked and unchecked
