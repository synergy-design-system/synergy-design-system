<Chapter title="Offerings">
- Design-Tokens, Assets, Components, Styles and Templates
- Modular and flexible UI components which can be put together like Lego blocks.
  - The components exist twice; as web- (development) and as Figma-components (design) which are always in-sync and have the exact same anatomy.
  - [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://react.dev) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) are first-class citizens. Due to the nature of web-components which are framework agnostic they run in all frameworks or without any. But we decided to give special support to those popular frameworks so they profit from better DX.
  - The web-components are accessible (A11Y)
- Auto-completion in TS, JS and HTML (VSCode)
- Customizability: easy and profound options for styling and branding via DesignTokens, CSS Variables and CSS Parts.
- Light and dark themes are included
- Material icons
- Support for all major browsers; tested with every release.
- Basic CSS styles for an easy application start
- Templates for typical and recurring UIs which can be copied.

<Chapter title="Roadmap">
Our roadmap is an up-to-date report on the work we’re doing and planning to do. New features and components are added continuously.

Like each roadmap, it is always subject to change and dates are just an orientation.
It should give you an idea what to expect in the upcoming months.
